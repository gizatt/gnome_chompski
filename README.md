# Gnome Chompski
![gnome_chompski](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/left4dead/images/7/77/Gnome_model.png)

CAD and code for a 3d printed prop from HL2:EP2 / HL:Alyx that contains an embedded uC and speaker that plays a random sounds from a library at programmable (by config file) intervals.

Model is based on [this excellent model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4259015/files), whose provenance I'm not sure of.
